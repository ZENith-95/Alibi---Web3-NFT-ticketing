Alibi - "Not Proof of Absence!"

A robust, user-centric MVP on ICP that demonstrates AI-generated NFT ticketing, QR-based entry, and post-event utility, prioritizing cost efficiency, scalability, and seamless integration between frontend and Motoko backend.

Core Features
AI-Generated NFT Tickets

Dynamic Art: Uses free-tier Stable Diffusion/DALL-E APIs to create unique SVG-based ticket designs.

Traits System: Randomized traits (e.g., "VIP," "Golden Border") stored in NFT metadata.

On-Chain Storage: Embed SVG artwork and QR codes directly into Motoko canisters to avoid external dependencies.

Event Creation & RSVP

Organizer Dashboard:

Input event details (name, date, capacity).

Select AI art style (e.g., "Cyberpunk," "Minimalist").

Preview and batch-generate 10 sample tickets.

Attendee Flow:

RSVP with Internet Identity → Mint NFT → Receive QR code.

QR Check-In System

Staff Interface: Mobile-first QR scanner with real-time validation.

On-Chain Verification: Motoko canister checks ticket status (active, used, invalid).

Post-Event Utility

Unlockables: Post-check-in, NFT metadata updates with secret links (e.g., Discord invites, discount codes).

Collectibles: Transform tickets into "Proof of Attendance" badges with AI-enhanced traits.

Technical Implementation
Frontend (React, NextJs)
UI Libraries:

react-qr-reader for scanning.

framer-motion for smooth transitions.

react-query for caching canister data.

Wallet Integration: Plug & Internet Identity for auth and NFT storage.

Responsive Design: Mobile-first layout with Tailwind CSS.

Backend (Motoko)
 
AI Integration
Free Tools:

Replicate.com (free tier) for Stable Diffusion XL.

QRCode.js for generating SVG QR codes.

Fallbacks:

Pre-generate 20 ticket designs for demo purposes.

Use CSS gradients/patterns if API fails.

Key Challenges & Mitigation
Challenge	Solution
AI API rate limits	Cache responses; use mock data for demos.
QR scan latency	Optimize Motoko canister queries.
Wallet connectivity issues	Provide clear error toasts and retry buttons.
SVG rendering lag	Preload assets; use <img> tags for SVGs.


Demo Script
Organizer:

Creates "Neon Nights 2024" event → Generates 10 AI tickets.

Attendee:

RSVPs → Mints NFT → Views QR code in wallet.

Staff:

Scans QR → Updates ticket status → Triggers unlockables.

Post-Event:

Attendee accesses secret Discord link via NFT.

Scalability Roadmap
Phase 1: Batch AI art generation for 1,000+ tickets.

Phase 2: Cross-chain compatibility (e.g., mint on ICP, resell on Ethereum).

Phase 3: DAO governance for event organizers.

Differentiators
Zero Gas Fees: ICP’s reverse gas model for seamless UX.

Provable Ownership: Dynamic NFTs with immutable attendance records.

Cost Efficiency: Fully on-chain storage (SVGs + metadata).

Final Deliverables:

Functional MVP with AI tickets, QR check-in, and unlockables.

GitHub repo with detailed setup guide.
